Q1: Evaluate each of the following Javascript expressions and show the value
1. ‐9*3         
2. “value is “ + 50   
3. 17 % 5         
4. 5 % 17        
5. 5/10         
6. (4 == 4)        
7. (4 != 5)  
8. (7 <= 8) 
9. Math.ceil(x) ‐ Math.floor(x) 

Q2 : Read a number (using prompt) and display it using alert

Q3 : Read in two numbers and display them in ascending order.

Q4: Read in two numbers and display the larger

Q5: Read two numbers and display their sum.  What problem did you encounter?

Q6: If you have a “num” variable,  Your task is to print:

- ONE, if it is equal to 1 .cod
- TWO, if it is equal to 2.
- THREE, if it is equal to 3 .
- FOUR, if it is equal to 4.
- FIVE, if it is equal to 5.
- SIX, if it is equal to 6 .
- SEVEN, if it is equal to 7.
- EIGHT, if it is equal to 8.
- NINE, if it is equal to 9.
- PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if there is none of the above.


Q7: Use a loop to display the numbers 0 through 5, each in a separate alert window.

Q8: Use a loop to display the numbers 0 through 5 in a single alert window

Q9: Use a loop to display the numbers in the range 0…20 that are multiples of 3. 

Q10: Prompt the user for a number in the range 0…100.  If the number is out of range, display an error message and prompt again until a valid number is entered.  Assume the user enters a number each time


Q11: Repeat previous exercise, but this time allow for the possibility that the user enters something that is not a number.  Hint: the built in function isNaN(x) returns true if x is not a number.  It returns false if x is a number.  Sort of backwards, but that's what's available.


Q12: Prompt for an integer, then display the sum of the integers from 0 through the number entered.  For example, if you enter 10, then display 55 which is the sum of   0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10


Q13: Prompt for an integer, then display the average of the integers from 0 through the number entered.  For example, if you enter 10, then display 5 which is the average of   (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)/11
